      <title>Changes</title>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 3.1.3 to 3.2.0</title>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>Print date as %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format), to avoid being ambiguous in international context.  Also always use the ':' as hour:minute separator (there was a couple of 'h' instead).</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>Don't fully disable a @-line when something goes wrong (e.g. fcron didn't shut down cleanly).  The idea was to prevent infinite loops, but this was overkill.  Instead set its next execution to now+frequency.`</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>Cosmetic changes in the log lines (quote the job shell commands) and fcrondyn (use the pipe char "|" as a column separator).</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>Fixed file descriptor leak when executing jobs in case of NSS failures (thanks Pavel Stano).</para>
	    </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

	 <title>From version 3.1.2 to 3.1.3</title>
	    <listitem>

	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>Fixed bug where LONG_MAX could potentially be used in functions like localtime(), which is too big for localtime().  This was unlikely to happen unless there was another problem in the first place.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>fcrondyn -x no longer adds null characters at the end of the output.  This would cause problems if the output was piped to something as grep.  Thanks Dimitri Semitsoglou-Tsiapos for pointing this out.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>Fixed minor bug in fcronsighup resulting in log errors about closing the signal file</para>

         <listitem>
            <para>Vixie cron compatibility: added options @reboot, @daily, @hourly, etc. Also added more generic options runatreboot, rebootreset and runonce.</para>
         </listitem>

         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>added audit (libaudit) support</para>
         </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Better validation of string arguments of fcrontab options. In particular for timezones, previously a space could be added at the beginning or the end of the timezone with no warning, and this led fcron to use an unexpected timezone, which could cause confusion.</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>Allow tasks to run every seconds</para>

            <para>fcron now sets the email headers X-Cron-Env and Auto-Submitted (as described in RFC 3834).</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>email encoding: fcron now sets the email headers Content-Type and Content-Transfer-Encoding. They can be controlled by setting the CONTENT_TYPE and CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING variables in fcrontabs.</para>

         </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Quite a lot of code clean-up and refactoring -- e.g. implemented generic unordred list for lavgq / exeq.</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 3.0.5 to 3.0.6</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fixed bug preventing normal user from running fcrontab -l if fcron's uid!=gid</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fixed fcrontab's PAM initialization when working on the systab user.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added check_system_crontabs.sh which is to replace the less portable check_system_crontabs.bash.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added option -c to check_system_crontabs.sh to specify a fcron.conf file to use</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fixed Makefile bug preventing installation when building from a different folder than the sources (wrong fcron.conf path)</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 3.0.4 to 3.0.5</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Security issue: fixed security issue that allowed malicious user to read any file readable by group 'fcron' (in particular fcron's config files and the fcrontabs of non-root users). On systems without seteuid() (i.e. quite exotic systems) then the bug is harder to exploit but any file could be read.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Improved general security of fcrontab and fcrondyn by dropping more privileges.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Work on portability (aix, hpux, irix, tru64 unix, solaris). Thanks Peter O'Gorman for his patch!</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Patched startup script to make it more compliant to the LSB.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Increased maximum number of fcrontab entries from 256 to 1024.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix: if fcron could not fork() to run a job, then the job would still appear to be running until fcron is restarted (thanks Alexander Y. Fomichev for noticing this bug).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix: fcrontab used to accept MAXENTRIES+1 fcrontab entries</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>chdir to /tmp before executing the editor (as some editor needs to be able to read information on the current folder).</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 3.0.3 to 3.0.4</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Initialize the random number generator with some values specific to the machine so as two fcron started exactly at the same time on two different machines run their random jobs at different time. This is useful for clusters for instance.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added option erroronlymail so as the output of a job is emailed only when the job exited with a non-zero status.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Bug fix: in certain conditions, jobs could be executed outside their interval of execution when using option random on %-lines.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fixed bug which prevented the pid of the job to be written to the (grand-)parent process. This was not a major issue but would prevent fcrondyn from working well with the concerned jobs. This bug was caused by a close() function applied twice on a file descriptor, which would trigger the bug in some rare occasions (only one affected linux system reported).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fixed bug which would stop fcron from running any job any more on the affected system and until fcron was restarted if the bug above occured.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Cleaned-up the closures of file descriptors (check for errors, etc).</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 3.0.3-rc1 to 3.0.3</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>The configure script now check that the make command is GNU make (which is required to build fcron).</para>
	    <para>Bug fix: better handling of getpwnam() errors (we cannot rely on errno to spot an error). This was causing problems for AIX for instance.</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 3.0.2 to 3.0.3-rc1</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>New configure scripts, with more standard default values for paths, etc. This aims at simplifying the packaging of fcron. Thanks go to Patrice Dumas for his patch!</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>New make targets: perms and strip. This aims at simplifying the packaging of fcron. Thanks go to Patrice Dumas for his patch!</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Set environment variable LOGNAME when running a job (as Vixie Cron does: thanks Martin McGreal for pointing that out).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Portability work for AIX 5.2 and Solaris 8 and 10 (thanks Martin McGreal).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Chmod()ed fcron's fifo file to 777. It was 666 previously, but the exec bit is needed for AIX and apparently ignored on other platforms, so we now set it to.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Set TZ environment variable for lines which uses fcron option timezone.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>A file was closed twice by fcrontab: removed the duplicate close().</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Replaced include sys/termios.h by termios.h.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fixed a fcrontab bug cause by an return value not handled and resulting in many useless (but pretty much harmless) iteration in a loop.</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 3.0.1 to 3.0.2</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Use sockaddr's field sa_len/sun_len on system defining it (BSD, ...). It should allow fcrondyn to connect to fcron on these systems.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Non-SELinux systems: run each job in a different session by calling setuid() for each one of them. This is to improve compatibility with Vixie cron.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Don't use the shell defined in /etc/passwd by default, but use the default value from fcron.conf instead. This is for compatibility with Vixie cron.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Use root name and group instead of root uid and gid. This seems more logical since the configure scripts asks for the name and group and not the uid and gid.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added an init file for Suse in script/ (contribution from Alex: thanks!).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Minor spelling fixes in the French documentation.</para>
	 </listitem>	 
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 3.0.0 to 3.0.1</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>fcrontab: access user's directory with user's rights (necessary if user/group fcron has not the right to read the directory).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>improvement in check_system_crontabs: more comments, added some help messages, added command line options, cleaner, safer code.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Improved English documentation: clarified some previously-unclear points.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added French translation of the manual pages (thanks go to Alain Portal)</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Removed old documentation from the package.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Better handling of the pipes in job.c: this should remove some problems encountered on BSD systems.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix: do not use a tv_usec > 999999: should fix the problem encountered on BSD systems with select().</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix: fixed a bug in make_msg(): the size of a string written to a buffer was not controlled correctly in some cases. This could result in buffer overflow and thus this was security problem. However the bug seems not exploitable as the part of the string which could overflow the buffer could not be freely defined by an attacker (it was either ": " or one of the strings returned by strerror()).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Bug fix: set the FDs correctly for select().</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

	       recent systems.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fixed a bug which prevented fcrondyn to being used on NetBSD (thanks go to Gabor Z. Papp).</para>

	    <para>made fcrontab behave better when there is no space left in the
	       spool directory (used to truncate the fcrontab source file).
	    </para>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added a script, check_system_crontabs, to emulate Vixie cron's
	       behavior about /etc/crontab and /etc/cron.d. Please have a look
	       at the top of script/check_system_crontabs for more information.
	    </para>

	    </para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Internal changes in log.c: code is more segmented, and code

	       strerror()).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>

	       things.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fixed a crash bug: in 2.9.4, if a user run ls_exeq when a job

	       that only root can run commands as superuser and use option
	       runas. Even an corrupted fcrontab should not be able to get
	       root's privileges. Pretty reassuring, isn't it?</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>runfreq(1) lines have been replaced and extended by a new kind
	       of line: the lines beginning by a "%". It's now possible to tell
	       fcron to run a command once an hour, a week, etc, but only at
	       some specified moments. For instance: '%weekly * 4-7 echo "foo"'
	       will run the command 'echo "foo"' once a week between 4 and 7 in
	       the morning. (see "man 5 fcrontab" for more details).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>installation process improved: user is now consulted before
	       anything is done about installation in boot scripts, etc. The
	       default username of fcron is now ... fcron! (this is more secure
	       than daemon, which can be used by other programs). </para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>fcron now adds the host name to the addresses of the mails it
	       sends.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>fcrontab determines the identity of the running user by his
	       uid (it used to use the var USER). That way, fcrontab should act
	       as crontab under a "su".</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed: a tmp file was not removed after a "fcron
	       -z"</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed in fcrontab: an expression of the form "start-stop"
	       with start > stop used to be incorrectly managed by fcron.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed: when fcron and fcrontab were installed under a
	       non-privileged user rights, a normal user used to be not able to
	       use fcrontab.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed: while fcrontab was asking user if he would like to
	       correct an erroneous line, the answer was not correctly
	       handled.</para>
